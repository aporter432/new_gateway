It is ideal for remotely monitoring and controlling fixed and portable assets in industries as diverse as transportation, oil and gas, utilities, maritime and more. The versatile, environmentally sealed ST 9100 is ideal for rugged environments in the world's most remote areas. The ST 9100 (Figure 1) is a satellite-cellular terminal. Features include the following: ¥ An lsatData Pro satellite-cellular transceiver for communicating with the network ¥ Part number ST9100-D01 for use in the Americas ¥ Part number ST9100-C0l for use outside of the Americas ¥ An integral multi-GNSS subsystem ¥ Four (4) general purpose I/Os ¥ Two (2) dedicated outputs ¥ Four (4) inputs (digital OR 0-5 V analog of which the first two can be configured as 4-20 mA) ¥ Two (2) RS-232 ports ¥ RS-485 port ¥ Two (2) CAN Bus ports ¥ 7-Wire interface ¥ 3-Axis 16-bit accelerometer ¥ Multiple SIM support ¥ Cellular module ¥ Bluetooth connectivity ¥ Internal backup battery ¥ Satellite antenna (p/n ST107165-AFA standard antenna, ST101166-AFA low elevation antenna) ¥ Cellular antenna - LTE/3G/2G fallback (p/n ST101066-001) ¥ Terminal shroud (optional- p/n ST101014-001) Figure 1: ST 9100 Satellite-Cellular Transceiver The transceiver's built-in programmability allows it to work as a standalone data-messaging transceiver, with built-in 1/0 data collection and processing capabilities. Feature-rich software tools make programming easy and shorten the design and testing time. The transceiver can also be configured with terminal apps. Terminal apps are configurable device-level applications that include specific feature sets that are implemented by ORBCOMM Contact Customer Support or your Account Manager for further details. 1.1 Overview of the Messaging System The lsatData Pro satellite messaging system is designed to support the management of mobile or fixed assets located around the world. An asset fitted with one of ORBCOMM's satellite based mobile terminals can have their status and locations monitored and send large messages. The network provides the following key features and benefits: ¥ Polling of terminal status and location ¥ Scheduled reporting of terminal status and location ¥ Transmission of text messages to and from a serial port on the transceiver ¥ Two-way communication for messaging to and from the asset for near real-time control ¥ Up to 6,399 bytes from-mobile messages ¥ Up to 10,000 bytes to-mobile messages ¥ Default acknowledged messages ¥ Global service Service is provided to end users by Solution Providers (SPs) who use the lsatData Pro network to offer particular applications and/or services to their clients. The SPs link their application services to the satellite terminals by connecting to the lsatData Pro gateway. This acts as the communications hub of the system, routing traffic to and from the terminals and the various service providers. The terminal can be configured to route cellular messages through the same lsatData Pro Gateway that supplies satellite messages. This is shown as Option 1 in the System Diagram. Option 2 represents a terminal configured to route cellular messages directly to a customer or Solution Provider proprietary cell server. In this case the connection to ORBCOMM's lsatData Pro Gateway supplies satellite messages. Refer to [T404, N206, and N21O] for more information about configuring the terminal's cellular messaging transport. Figure 2: System Architecture The satellite-cellular terminal is based on Lua software and is supported by a suite of lsatData Pro tools, enabling SPs a programmable platform they can tailor to their specific applications 1.2 Terminal Note: Hardware components may not be exactly as shown in this document. A terminal consists of a transceiver unit plus antennas. Transceivers with a standard antenna operate on the lsatData Pro network at an elevation angle of 20¡ to go0 and -5¡ to go0 for transceivers with low elevation antennas. The transceivers are self-contained, compact, and provide low power consumption. A cellular module is available to operate over the cellular network The transceiver's built-in programmability allows it to work as a stand-alone with built-in 1/0 data collection and processing capabilities. Terminals are suitable for the AVL market. Feature-rich software tools make application design easy and shorten the design and testing time. ORBCOMM also provides consulting services to SPs to help program the transceiver and get customer applications running quickly. 1.3 Transceiver Components CAUTION: Do not rely solely on the terminal for emergency (SOS) calls. In addition to the features mentioned earlier, the transceiver has the following benefits: ¥ Designed to be used as a standalone or incorporated into an SP solution ¥ Built-in dual-GNSS receiver to calculate position, speed, and heading ¥ Quick and easy installation reduces labor time and costs ¥ Installed firmware ¥ Flexible custom application design (Lua Services Framework) ¥ Wide operational temperature range ¥ Satellite plus cellular modem integration ¥ Discrete 1/0 ports to interface with a wide range of after-market accessories ¥ Rugged construction 1.3.1 Transceiver Unit Each transceiver is a self-contained unit, including a satellite/cellular modem, a multi-GNSS module, programmable microcontroller, and multiple discrete and analog I/Os (input/output) capable of monitoring and controlling external sensors and devices. Ideal for mobile applications, it is also suitable for fixed installations. Arranging the transceiver unit's connectors (Figure 3) at one end of the unit simplifies installation. Sturdy flanges on the side make mounting quick and easy. Figure 3: Connector Position An anti-tamper SIM door on the back side of the transceiver (Figure 4) provides easy access to the SIM card holder and reset button. Figure 4: SIM Access Door Figure 5: Reset Button 1.3.2 Satellite Antenna CAUTION: Use only color-matching antennas. The satellite-cellular transceiver's satellite antenna is waterproof and designed to operate in extreme environments. It has four mounting flanges for installation. The satellite antenna connects to the transceiver using a 5 m (7 6 ft.) cable terminated with a curry yellow colored FAKRA RF connector. The satellite-cellular transceiver is available with either the standard satellite antenna (Figure 6) or the low elevation satellite antenna (Figure 7). Figure 6: Standard Satellite Antenna Figure 7: Low Elevation Satellite Antenna 1.3.3 Cellular Antenna CAUTION: Use only color-matching antennas. The ST 9100 cellular antenna is an LTE antenna with a burgundy colored FAKRA connector. Figure 8: Cellular Antenna 1.3.4 Terminal Shroud Use the optional terminal shroud if mounting the transceiver outdoors. Figure 9: Terminal Shroud 1.3.5 ST 9100 Cables and Connectors The following are available for the ST 9100: ¥ A 5-meter blunt cut cable (p/n ST101 062-002).

The voltage on the 1/0 pin may not drop low enough to present a logic zero to the host processor when the ignition is turned off. In such a case 1/0_7 can be configured to switch in a 4 kOhm load to draw the voltage below the logic zero threshold level of the host processor ensuring a logic zero. The other 1/0 ports should not be used for ignition monitoring. Refer to section 2.4.1.7 1/0_4 provides dedicated overcurrent/short circuit protection circuitry when operated in the open drain, switch-to.ground mode. The other I/Os do not have this circuitry therefore 1/0_4 is recommended for applications requiring overcurrent/short circuit protection. Simplified block diagrams of the 1/0 when configured as digital inputs, digital outputs, and analog inputs are shown in the figures below (Figure 11, Figure 12, and Figure 13). The transceiver also supports two dedicated outputs (Output_5 and Output_6). More information on these outputs can be found in section 2.3.1. 2.4.1.1 Digital Input Figure 11 shows a schematic of the 1/0 when configured as a digital input. Figure 11: Digital Input Input Type S1 S2 With weak pull-down Open Open With pull-downOpen Closed With pull-up Closed Open The input specifications are provided in the table below. Parameter Min.

These outputs are capable of sinking current only. Both outputs are controlled from the host processor. The outputs are not protected against over current conditions and you must ensure that the maximum current capability of the internal switch is not exceeded. Both outputs include ESD protection. You must also ensure that the voltage applied to the output pin does not exceed the maximum value as shown in the table below. Figure 14: Open Drain Outputs Parameter Max.

In low power applications, frequent GPS fixes can dominate the power budget. To reduce the power budget effects of GPS fixes, the accelerometer can be used to detect if motion has occurred. The accelerometer thresholds to detect advanced features such as driver behavior monitoring vary depending on the environment. To avoid false detects, extensive testing is required to ensure that adequate acceleration magnitude thresholds and time durations are used.
