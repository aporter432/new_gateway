# ISAT DATAPRO System Introduction

## Overview
The ST (Satellite Terminal) products are designed to integrate with the IsatData Pro gateway, providing a comprehensive messaging system for managing mobile and fixed assets across wide geographical areas. This system enables real-time monitoring of asset state and location through two-way communication.

## System Capabilities

### Message Handling
- **From-Mobile Messages**: Up to 6,399 bytes
- **To-Mobile Messages**: Up to 10,000 bytes
- **Communication**: Two-way, near real-time control
- **Coverage**: Very wide geographical areas
