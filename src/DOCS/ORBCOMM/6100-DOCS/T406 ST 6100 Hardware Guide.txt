The ST 6100 is available in various configurations. Figure 1: ST 6100 Each ST 6100 is designed for industrial and fixed applications or to be mounted outdoors on a wide range of platforms such as vehicles or boats. The ST 6100 is designed for harsh industrial applications and can be used for applications that support both fixed and mobile (for example, trucks and boats) assets. The terminal’s built-in programmability allows it to work as a standalone data-messaging terminal, with built-in I/O data collection and processing capabilities. Feature-rich software tools make programming easy and shorten the design and testing time. 1.1 Terminals The ST 6100 (Table 1) operates on the IsatData Pro network. The ST 6100 is self-contained, environmentally sealed, compact, and provides low power consumption. Terminals include an omnidirectional antenna, satellite modem, GPS, programmable microcontroller, accelerometer, and several I/O (input/output) feeds capable of monitoring and controlling external sensors and terminals. The built-in programmability allows it to work as a standalone terminal with built-in I/O data collection and processing capabilities. Each model is suitable for both mobile and fixed installations. Feature-rich software tools make scripting easy, and shorten the script design and testing time. Table 1: ST 61xx Models Terminals are available in two configurations: bottom connector or side connector (see figures below) Figure 2: ST 6100 with Side Connector Figure 3: ST 6100 with Bottom Connector 1.2 Key Features and Benefits The ST 6100 has the following key features and benefits: • Designed to be used as a standalone or incorporated into a Solution Provider’s (SP) solution • Built-in multi-GNSS receiver to calculate position, speed and heading with SP-preferred constellation • Quick and easy installation reduces labor time and costs • Very low power consumption enables a wide variety of autonomous applications • Ships with installed firmware that is over-the-air upgradeable for significant cost and schedule savings, and convenience • Wide operational temperature range to support a very broad range of applications and geographies • Rugged construction to support applications in the harshest environments • Supports SP-developed application scripts with Lua Service Framework, enabling SPs to introduce an extremely high level of customization • Supports ORBCOMM out-of-the-box Agents that provide proven sophisticated applications with configurability, allowing reduced time to market for SPs 1.3 Operational States The terminal has several operational states. Table 2: Operational States Transmit In transmit mode the terminal is transmitting a signal to the satellite. Receive In receive mode the terminal is attempting or actively listening to the satellite. Processing In its processing mode the Lua services are actively running. For example, a wake-up to monitor a geofence. Sleep There are two parts to this state in a terminal. The modem turns itself off between wake-up intervals. Both the terminal and gateway track the wake-up interval. Consequently, when a terminal is in sleep it does not miss incoming messages. If a modem has a message to send, it automatically exits sleep state without waiting for the next wake-up interval. The other part of this state is when the terminal is set to Power Save, which is enabled by default. In power save, the terminal’s controller draws minimal current. It monitors its external inputs (digital and serial) for activity, and reacts as required by transitioning to processing state with no loss of information such as incoming serial characters. Idle With IsatData Pro, a modem receives messages in one of the 10 half second subframes. In Idle state the modem turns off its receiver waiting for its next assigned subframe. The modem automatically enters Idle state on its own, independent of the application. If Power Save is disabled and the terminal is not receiving or transmitting or processing, it is in the Idle state. 1.3.1 Application Peripherals These peripherals are either on or off. Power consumption is affected when they are powered on. Table 3: Application Peripherals 2 COMPLIANCE The terminal has received the following certifications: Inmarsat Type Approval Industry Canada FCC Part 15 FCC Part 25 CAUTION: Mount the terminal at least 20 cm away from humans. CE Mark SAE J1455 Ingress Protection RoHS • Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) 1 Anatel 1European Union's (EU) Directive 2002/95/EEC "Restriction of Hazardous Substances" (RoHS) in Electronic and Electrical Equipment. 3 SPECIFICATIONS 3.1 Temperature 3.2 Temperature Sensor 3.3 Connectors The terminals use a circular 10-pin (Chogori) connector. 3.3.1 Connector Pin Assignment Figure 4: Terminal Connector Pin Assignment (Male) Table 4: Electrical Pin Assignment (ST 6100) Figure 5: View of terminal Male Connector Figure 6: Face View of Mating Connector (Female) Figure 7: Rear View of Mating Connector (Solder Cups) 3.4 Power 3.4.1 Input Range 3.4.2 Power Consumption Typical power consumption values at VIN=12 V and at room temperature (23°C) Table 5: Power Consumption 3.4.2.1 Average Power Consumption The satellite receive current is specified at 59 mA. At times, the receiver might continuously be on when the terminal is searching for a satellite signal, receiving network updates or waiting for acknowledgment responses. However, in normal operation the receiver is not on continuously, instead it wakes up once every five (5) seconds to receive, which results in an average 7.6 mA consumption, at 12 V (152 mAh/day). In low power mode, the average terminal power consumption is decreased further depending on the wake-up period that extends the modem wake-up period from a default five (5) seconds. The overall power consumption depends on many factors including how often the modem wakes to receive to-mobile messages, how often GPS fixes are requested, the size and frequency of mobile messages and LED settings. Refer to [T204] for additional details on low power operation. 3.4.2.2 Blockage Power If a terminal is blocked so that it cannot receive the satellite signals, it must scan to reacquire the traffic channels. While scanning for traffic channels, the terminal consumes more power than when it has acquired a traffic channel. For powered applications, the terminal continually scans for a satellite so that it can reacquire quickly when blockage is removed. Refer to [N200] for additional details on network blockage behavior. The table below shows the terminal configured for MobileMinBattery power profile and with 3 minute and 1 minute GPS fix timeouts. The GPS fix time is a modem register that limits the amount of time the terminal waits for a GPS fix. A long GPS fix time as per the 3 minute default allows time for the GPS to acquire in a partially blocked location. However, GPS consumes considerable power and shortening the acquisition time saves power if terminal is blocked and will never acquire GPS. The GPS Fix time can be restricted by two properties maxFixTimeout (PIN 20) and acquireTimeout (PIN 19) in the Position service (SIN 20). maxFixTimeout defines the timeout for any fix while acquireTimeout defines the timeout for the GPS to see at least one satellite. Table 6: Blockage Power Consumption (Power Profile = MobileMinBattery) 3.4.2.3 Blockage Recovery In the battery powered profiles, a consequence of the blockage algorithm is that the longer the terminal is blocked, the longer it takes for the terminal to detect that the blockage condition has been removed. However, an application could use external events such as a digital input (connected to ignition) to force the terminal to force a new satellite channel search if movement is likely to have occurred. The satellite traffic channel check can be forced by writing any value, including the current value to the modem’s wake-up interval. It is important that the application not write to the wake-up interval frequently, as each write will trigger a search that consumes significant power. When the application forces a check by writing to the wake-up interval, the terminal blockage algorithm resumes normal operation if the traffic channel is correctly received. If the terminal cannot find the traffic channel after the search, the terminal resumes the blockage algorithm. A satellite traffic channel check can also be forced by changing the power mode. In this case, the blockage algorithm restarts all its timers and commences again from the beginning if traffic channels are not detected. 3.4.3 Load Dump Circuitry The terminal's power supply input voltage range is 9 to 32 V. Above this range the load dump protection circuitry disconnects external power so that the terminal is not damaged, up to 150V. When the input voltage drops below the threshold, the terminal recovers, going through power on reset. With this protection, the terminal is capable of withstanding load dumps as specified in SAE J1455 (rev JUN2006) paragraph 4.13.2.2.1. 3.4.4 Fuse The terminals have an internal 5 A fuse, which provides protection in the event of an internal short on the terminal. The internal fuse cannot be reset and is not field repairable. 3.4.5 Inrush Current Inrush current transients occur when the terminal is: • First powered on. • Preparing for transmit. This is when the terminal switches its internal voltage rail to a higher voltage for transmitting. • Terminal starts to transmit. This is when the terminal's power amplifier is turned on. Table 7: Inrush Current1 3.5 Input/Output The terminal's four configurable I/O lines are each independently operable in one of following modes: • Digital Input • Digital Output • Analog Input • Disabled 3.5.1 Digital Input The figure below shows a schematic of the I/O when configured as a digital input. Figure 8: Digital Input 1Input voltage is 12 V at 23°C. The input specifications are provided in the table below. Parameter Min.

It must be noted that I/O 04 is the only I/O with built-in short circuit protection for open drain outputs. Figure 9: Digital Output The following tables describe the output specifications. Push-pull In the push-pull configuration the output is driven directly from the microprocessor. Open Drain 3.5.3 Analog Input The figure below shows a schematic of the I/O when configured as an analog input. 1This value is dependent on the Lua services being used. This is not a hardware limitation. The hardware limit is specified by the output bandwidth. 2This value is dependent on the Lua services being used. This is not a hardware limitation. The hardware limit is specified by the output bandwidth. 3.5.3.1 Analog Accuracy The terminal measures the analog inputs using the GND pin as a reference. As the GND pin is shared with the power supply, return current can create a voltage drop between the GND pin and the power supply, which in many cases changes the reference point for the analog voltage. If analog accuracy is required, as per Figure 11, the power supply cables should be designed to limit voltage drop. As well, the application should be aware that current is a function of input voltage and the operating mode (receive, transmit, sleep). 1This value is dependent on the Lua services being used. This is not a hardware limitation. The hardware limit is specified by the input bandwidth. Alternatively for accurate analog measurements, the analog reference can be connected on a separate conductor to GND as per Figure 12. In this case, it is important that the power supply’s return is fully isolated from the analog reference voltage to ensure return current does not flow to analog reference. 3.6 Serial Interfaces 3.6.1 RS-232 The RS-232 interface defaults to the following settings: 9600 bps, 1 start, 8 data, 1 stop bit, no parity. The baud rate is configurable up to 115,200 bps. • Rx is protected up to ±25 V • Tx is protected up to ±13.2 V • Rx and Tx have ±15 kV ESD protection The electrical characteristics of the interface are: 3.6.1.1 Auto RS-232 Power On/Off The terminal uses the input voltage to turn the RS-232 driver on/off when auto RS-232 mode is selected. 3.6.2 RS-485 The electrical characteristics of the two wire RS-485 interface are below. 3.7 RF Specifications 3.7.1 Frequency 3.7.2 Antenna 3.8 GNSS The manufacturer's specifications are given in the table below. Table 8: Multi-GNSS Specifications 3.9 Accelerometer The terminal has an internal 3D accelerometer to detect motion in any axis. Figure 13 shows the positive axes for the accelerometer. 1All satellites at -130 dBm 2CEP, 50%, 24 hours static, -130 dBm The accelerometer is very important for low power terminals when it is critical to save power while stationary and quickly detect when motion starts. In powered terminals where low power is not critical, GPS can be polled to detect motion. However, for low power applications frequent GPS fixes can dominate the power budget. To reduce power budget effects of GPS fixes, an accelerometer can be used to trigger a GPS fix to detect if motion occurred. The accelerometer thresholds to detect motion vary depending on the environment. In order to avoid, false motion detects, extensive testing is required to ensure that adequate acceleration magnitude thresholds and time durations are used. Refer to [T405] for further details about the accelerometer. Table 9: Accelerometer Specifications If using the accelerometer, mount the terminal in one of the configurations shown in [T405]. 3.10 Mechanical The terminal’s mechanical enclosure is a rugged, impact, and chemical resistant plastic material.
